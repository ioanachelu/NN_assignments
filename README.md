### To run: 
    python run.py
### To run confusion matrix on learned model
    python run_conf_matrix.py

* network and layer forward backward are in ```network.py```
* function to construct and plot confusion matrix is in ```utils.py```
* solver and dataset loading are in ```run.py```
* I used keras dataset loading functionality
* test runs are in ```test_*.txt``` files
* I included some of the learned models and an example confusion matrix
